Derrick Wilder, GS ‘05, said Awn was instrumental in his decision to return to school through General Studies nearly 20 years after he graduated from high school. Prior to GS, Wilder pursued a career in professional dance even ran his own company. [NEWLINE] “I was unsure if I wanted to return at school after starting a professional life, and after [a conversation with Awn], I was put at ease. People often say, ‘my door’s always open,’ and it’s just a saying. His door was actually always open no matter when you showed up. … He started to plant the seeds in how you could make a change in how you behave,” Wilder said. 

“Having people in a big institution make you feel like you’re a part of it, regardless of where you come from and who you were, and make you proud of all those things that sometimes can be seen as something holding you back [was what Awn did]. He makes you flourish into who you are. ... He made GS be what GS is. He is the school, he is GS,” Ana Almanzar, GS’07, said.

Annie Cardelus, GS ‘91, met Awn at an alumni event. She wore a pink and grey striped sock in honor of his style. “He was just funny, charismatic, energetic. [He] loved General Studies—he was a community builder. I’m here to represent the community he built,” Cardelus said.  

Awn, Joan Arnold, GS ‘72, said, was the one who influenced her to trek across the world through their conversations. Though Arnold did not know Awn personally during her time as and undergraduate, she met eventually him at an alumni event. “I just love Dean Awn. He was the one that interested me to go to the Middle East; Morocco and Turkey.” Arnold said.
